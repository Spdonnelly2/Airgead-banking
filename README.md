# Airgead-banking

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to creat a program that would calculate interest based on deposits and interest rates.

What did you do particularly well?
I thought I did really good with this project. the user interface worked really well for the user.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Probably could have simplified some things but time did not permit.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Just getting the user interface to be right. Also my math calculations were off a few time so that slowed me down. I had to slowly line by line go through the math and see why it was not doing the math correct.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The use of multiple files creates less clutter and keeps codes neat and easy to be read.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
wrote a pretty simple code using 3 different files to call upon
